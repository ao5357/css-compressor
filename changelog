### [DATE]
### Corey Hart @ http://www.codenothing.com

# New Features
- Better options handling
- Look behind regexs are used to not break urls
- Singleton access added
- Exposing byte unit conversion display

# Possible Breaks
- The compressor no longer self instantiates itself, you must explicitly initialize it.
- Most methods that were never meant to be public, have been turned into private/protected based on accessibility requirements.
